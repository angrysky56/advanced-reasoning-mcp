### Basic Advanced Reasoning
```typescript

const result = await callTool("advanced_reasoning", {
  thought: "I need to analyze the query execution plan first",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  confidence: 0.8,
  reasoning_quality: "high",
  meta_thought: "This is a logical first step, high confidence approach",
  goal: "Optimize database query performance"
});
```

### Hypothesis Testing
```typescript
const result = await callTool("advanced_reasoning", {
  thought: "The bottleneck appears to be in the JOIN operations",
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  confidence: 0.6,
  reasoning_quality: "medium",
  meta_thought: "Need to verify this with actual data",
  hypothesis: "JOIN operations are causing 80% of query time",
  test_plan: "Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE and check execution times"
});
```

### Memory Integration
```typescript
// Query related memories (no session_id needed)
const memories = await callTool("query_reasoning_memory", {
  query: "database optimization techniques"
});
```

### SystemJSON Usage
```typescript
// Store a workflow for reuse
const workflow = await callTool("create_system_json", {
  name: "api_testing_workflow",
  domain: "software_development",
  description: "Complete API testing methodology",
  data: {
    phases: ["setup", "unit_tests", "integration_tests", "performance_tests"],
    tools: ["jest", "supertest", "newman"],
    checklist: ["auth validation", "error handling", "rate limiting"]
  },
  tags: ["testing", "api", "workflow"]
});

// Retrieve the workflow later
const storedWorkflow = await callTool("get_system_json", {
  name: "api_testing_workflow"
});
```
